# Progress Log

PRD: greeting-message
Started: 2026-01-27

## Codebase Patterns

- **Component location**: Components go in `components/` (not `components/ui/` which is for Base UI primitives)
- **Styling**: Use Tailwind CSS with `cn()` helper from `@/lib/utils` for conditional classes
- **Props pattern**: Accept optional `className` prop for customization

## Task - ui-1

- Created reusable `Greeting` component at `components/greeting.tsx`
- Displays "Welcome to the app!" text
- Styled with Tailwind CSS (centered, white/80 text, medium font weight)
- Accepts optional `className` prop for customization
- **Files changed:** `components/greeting.tsx` (new)
- **Learnings:** Simple UI components in this codebase are Server Components by default (no 'use client'). Only add 'use client' when interactivity is needed.

## Task - ui-2

- Imported and added `Greeting` component to the dashboard home page
- Placed greeting above the page header with `mb-6` spacing
- **Files changed:** `app/(dashboard)/page.tsx`
- **Learnings:** The actual home page is at `app/(dashboard)/page.tsx` due to the route group structure, not `app/page.tsx` as indicated in the PRD context. Always check actual file locations rather than assuming based on docs.
