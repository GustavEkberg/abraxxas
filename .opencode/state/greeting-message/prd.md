**Date:** 2026-01-24

---

## Problem Statement

### What problem are we solving?

Users land on the application without any personalized acknowledgment, creating a cold first impression.

### Why now?

Testing the PRD workflow to validate the process works correctly.

### Who is affected?

- **Primary users:** All visitors to the application

---

## Proposed Solution

### Overview

Add a simple greeting message component that displays "Welcome to the app!" on the home page.

---

## End State

When this PRD is complete, the following will be true:

- [ ] A greeting message displays on the home page
- [ ] The greeting component is reusable

---

## Acceptance Criteria

### Task 1: Create Greeting Component

- [ ] Component exists at `components/greeting.tsx`
- [ ] Displays "Welcome to the app!" text
- [ ] Uses Tailwind CSS for styling

### Task 2: Add Greeting to Home Page

- [ ] Greeting component is imported in the home page
- [ ] Greeting appears above the main content

---

## Non-Goals (v1)

- Personalized greetings based on user name - deferred until auth is implemented
- Internationalization - separate initiative
